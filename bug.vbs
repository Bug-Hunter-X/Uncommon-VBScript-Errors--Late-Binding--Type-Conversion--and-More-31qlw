Late Binding and Implicit Type Conversion Issues: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors if an object doesn't support a method or property you're trying to use.  Implicit type conversion can cause unexpected results, especially when working with numbers and strings. For example, comparing a string "10" to a number 10 might not yield the expected result.  Another issue is that VBScript lacks strong typing.  If you pass the wrong type of variable to a function, you might encounter unpredictable behavior.
